ReleaseDate: 2022-10-29
ReleaseNotes: "\u2022 Support for OpenSSH certificates, for both user authentication
  keys and host keys. \u2022 New SSH proxy modes, for running a custom shell command
  or subsystem on the proxy server instead of forwarding a port through it. \u2022
  New plugin system to allow a helper program to provide responses in keyboard-interactive
  authentication, intended to automate one-time password systems. \u2022 Support for
  NTRU Prime post-quantum key exchange, \u2022 Support for AES-GCM (in the OpenSSH
  style rather than RFC 5647). \u2022 Support for more forms of Diffie-Hellman key
  exchange: new larger integer groups (such as group16 and group18), and support for
  using those and ECDH with GSSAPI. \u2022 Bug fix: the 32-bit Windows build now runs
  on Windows XP again. \u2022 Bug fix: server-controlled window title setting now
  works again even if the character set is ISO 8859 (or a few other affected single-byte
  character sets). \u2022 Bug fix: certain forms of OSC escape sequences (sent by
  some real servers) could cause PuTTY to crash. \u2022 Bug fix: the -pwfile/-pw options
  no longer affect local key passphrase prompts, and no longer suppress Plink's anti-spoofing
  measures. \n"
